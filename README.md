Ember Services for working with ArcGIS Portal/Online

**Note**  This is still a very nascent project, and things will change.

We recommend locking to a specific version in your own `package.json` - although we try to avoid breaking changes,

### ArcGIS Portal Services
After adding this to your project, you will have a number of services available for injection into your routes/controllers/services.

### Dependencies
This project is now using `ember-fetch`, which is included in dependencies.

If you're using `torii` for oauth management, please also `npm install torii-provider-arcgis`. More information [here](https://github.com/dbouwman/torii-provider-arcgis).
Otherwise, you can use the `portalOpts` parameter described below, but you need a service named `session` in your app or addon. You can generate a dummy service using `ember generate service session`. *TODO: there's probably a better way to do this...*

### Installation
To consume this library in any ember application:
* `ember install ember-arcgis-portal-services`

### Shared Methods
All the services expose a set of shared helper properties and methods:

| Property | Returns | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `geocodeUrl` | `string` | Return the geocode base url |

**NOTE: Most public methods take an optional portalOpts parameter. This takes the form:**

```js
{
  portalHostname: 'some.portal.com',
  token: 'BZSOMETOKENQJ'
}
// it might also look like this
{
  portalHostname: 'https://some.portal.com',
  token: 'BZSOMETOKENQJ'
}
```

| Method |  Returns | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `encodeForm` | `string` | This is used internally. Formats an object into a html form. In most cases, not necessary to call this.|
| `request (url, options, portalOpts)` | `promise` | This is used internally. Promisified xhr that does basic handling of Portal's 400-in-a-200 errors |

  providers: {
    'arcgis-oauth-bearer': {
